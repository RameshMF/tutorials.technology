== Networking with Linux

=== SSH access to the server

The `ssh` command provides secure, encrypted access to a server.
Use `ssh IP-address` or `ssh your_hostname` to access the server.

To upload your public ssh key which allows you to login automatically into a server use the following command.

[source,console]
----
ssh-copy-id youruser@yourserver
----


[NOTE]
====
You can also assign a shortname for an IP address via the `config` file in your  `~/.ssh` directory.

For example, to create an alias called _foo_ for the IP address 144.76.74.162 and to use the user called _testing_ switch to
your `~/.ssh` directory, create the  `config` file if it does not exists and enter the following.

[source,console]
----
include::res/hosts/config[]
----

=== Execute a shell script on a remote machine

http://www.hamvocke.com/blog/a-quick-and-easy-guide-to-tmux/[Tmux] allows to run multiple command line sessions that continue to run even after you log out from SSH.
You can later connect to them again.

To create a new tmux session named `database` type this into your console:

[source, console]
----
tmux new -s database
----

To detach from your current session press kbd:[C-b d].
Your session will continue to run in the background.

To see all running background processes use the following command

[source,console]
----
tmux ls
----

To attach for example to the first one again use:

[source,console]
----
tmux attach -t 0
----

To attach to a named session just replace `0` with the respective session name:
[source, console]
----
tmux attach -t database
----

To scroll in tmux use kbd:[Ctrl-b+[] . 
Now you can use the normal scroll keys to scroll.
Press q to quit scroll mode.

=== See all open ports on your machine

You see all listeners on your machine via the following command.
Port which listen to 127.0.0.1 cannot get accessed from external.

[source,console]
----
include::res/network/openports.txt[]
----

=== Firewall

Ubuntu provides a uncomplicated firewall (ufw). 
To install it and only allow SSH, FTP, and webtraffic use the following command.

[source,console]
----
include::res/ufw/setup.txt[]
----

[source]
----
sudo apt-get install exim4
----

Here is an example /etc/exim4/update-exim4.conf.conf file.

[source]    
----
dc_eximconfig_configtype='smarthost'
dc_other_hostnames=''
dc_local_interfaces='127.0.0.1 ; ::1'
dc_readhost='gilbert.vogella.com'
dc_relay_domains=''
dc_minimaldns='false'
dc_relay_nets=''
dc_smarthost='smtp.gmail.com:587'
CFILEMODE='644'
dc_use_split_config='true'
dc_hide_mailname='false'
dc_mailname_in_oh='true'

You need to enter valid user credentials in the passwd.client file in the following format.

----
*google.com:youruser@gmail.com:yourpassword

Afterwards you need to enable the new configuration with the following command.

[source]    
----
sudo update-exim4.conf

The log files are located in `/var/log/exim4`.

=== HTTP debugging with curl

curl is a command line tool to issue and receive http (and other) request. 
For example, if you want to see the HTTP output of a webpage, use the following command.

[source,console]
----
include::res/network/curlgetpage.txt[]

You can set HTTP header information with the -h flag.
For example, to request a certain MIME type use the -H'Accept:MIME' option.

[source,console]
