== Creating and updating a Gerrit change request from Eclipse

In the following description we create a Gerrit change request.

After getting the latest source code, when you are ready for development, create a new local branch starting from the origin/master branch.

Perform some changes in your Java project.
Commit the changes and ensure to select the _Add Change-Id_ button in the _Git Staging_ view.

The Change-ID is what uniquely identifies the change in Gerrit.
The
entry is initially set to
`Change-Id: I0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`.
During the commit, this is replaced with an ID generated by the Git
tooling.

Push the change to Gerrit. As your push configuration is configured for Gerrit, this
should create a change. The
Eclipse Git tooling
shows a dialog after
the push. This dialog contains
error messages in case the push was not
successful.
Via the URL you can access the Gerrit web
interface
and
analyze the
Gerrit review.

Do a few new changes to your Java project and commit them to your
local Git repository. Ensure that you amend the
existing commit. This
makes sure the
existing
change id is used and avoids that Gerrit cannot
apply your change
because of
a dependency cycle on the commits. Push
your new commit
to Gerrit, this should update the existing review
request. The
Eclipse Git push confirmation dialog should tell you that
you created a new change set.

== Combining changes from two commits / Gerrit change reviews

Sometimes you want to update an existing Gerrit but push a new commit which creates a new Gerrit.
So you have two Gerrit change reviews, instead of one.

Here is what you have to do to combine them:

* Use Ctrl+3 Fetch from Gerrit and fetch the second Gerrit into your local repository
* Go to the history view, you will see both commits
* Select the last commit before the two commits which you want to combine
* Right-mouse clicke and select _Rebase Interactive_
* In the _Rebase_ view, select `Fixup` on the second commit to combine two commits using the commit message from the first commit.
* Press _Start_ to run the interactive rebase
* Push the changed commit to Gerrit, this will update the first Gerrit, as the `Change-Id` is still the same.
* Abandon the second commit
