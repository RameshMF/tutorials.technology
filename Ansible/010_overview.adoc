== Ansible

`Ansible` is an open source tool for automated software provisioning and application deployment.
It is developed by Ansible Inc., owned by Red Hat Inc., with help from the community.
Ansible works by connecting to remote or local machines via SSH and executing predefined tasks.
In comparison to other deployment automation tools Ansible is deemed simpler while still being very powerful.
Ansible doesn't use a server/client architecture by default.
You can execute Ansible from your local machine while the remote machines don't need an Ansible installation.
