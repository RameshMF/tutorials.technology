== Using the Eclipse IDE as Asciidoc editor

Currently the best Asciidoc editor plug-in for the Eclipse IDE is provided by https://github.com/de-jcup/eclipse-asciidoctor-editor.

You can install it via its Marketplace entry: https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/asciidoctor-editor


It provides an editor and a preview tab for Asciidoc.

One nice feature is that if you hold the CTRL (Command key on Mac), you can open files included with the `include::` directive.

[NOTE]
====
An alternative it the Mylyn Wiki Text plugin but it is not that feature rich.
The `Mylyn WikiText Extras feature` can be installed from the http://download.eclipse.org/mylyn/snapshots/nightly/docs/  update site.
