== Settings for the PDF output

=== Title page

The title page of a pdf document can include the following attributes:

* Title
* Subtitle
* Author
* Revision

This attributes can be styled in the file _basic-theme.yml_ in folder _themes_.


=== Links

To see the links in the generated output use the following attribute in the header of you document.

[source,console]
----
:show-link-uri:
----

NOTE: Before release alpha.13 you have to use the :showlinks: attribute instead.

Also you can configure the label for a chapter via the `chapter-label` attribute, e.g. if you do not want any label you can use:

[source,console]
----
:chapter-label:
----

Unfortunately Asciidoctor does not add a page break before a  part if you use "book" as output.
See https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-pdf/issues/329.
As workaround you have to put manual line breaks into it with `<<<`.

=== Index

You can add an index to your pdf output by defining it as follows:

....
[index]
= Index
....

This will list all the defined indexes. The output will look like this:

image::index.png[]


=== Appendix

The appendix is defined as follows:

....
[appendix]
= Appendix
....



=== Styling the PDF output

In order to style the PDF output use the file _basic-theme.yml_ in folder _themes_.
In this file you can style the title page, the headings (h1, h2, h3, etc), the images and many more objects.

For example to style the heading do the following entry in the _basic-theme.yml_ file:

----
heading:
  font_style: bold
  h1:
    font_color: 999999
    font_style: italic
    align: right
----

A useful feature is to set a default width for images in the pdf output. To achieve this do the following entry:

----
image:
  width: 60%
----

=== Publishing Mode

In order to use some publishing attributes you must set the `media` attribute in the header of your AsciiDoc document as follows:

`:media: prepress`

This attribute will trigger the following settings:

* Double-sided (mirror) page margins

* Automatic facing pages

==== Double-sided (mirror) page margins

The double-sided page margins will have the following impact:
the page margins for the recto (right-hand, odd-numbered) and verso (left-hand, even-numbered) pages will be replaced by the side page margins with the values of the  page_margin_inner and page_margin_outer keys.

You can define the page_margin_inner and page_margin_outer in the theme.
This will look as follows:

[source,text]
----
page:
  margin: [0.5in, 0.67in, 0.67in, 0.67in]
  margin_inner: 0.75in
  margin_outer: 0.59in
----

These settings will trigger the following change to the output:

----
recto page margin
[0.5in, 0.59in, 0.67in, 0.75in]

verso page margin
[0.5in, 0.75in, 0.67in, 0.59in]
----

==== Automatic facing pages

Regarding to the automatic facing pages, a blank page will be inserted, if necessary, to ensure the following pages are right-hand-facing pages:

* Title page
* Table of contents
* First page of body content
* Parts and chapters 

Itâ€™s possible to disable the automatic facing feature for a given part or chapter. 
This can be done by adding the nonfacing option *[%nonfacing]* to the section node. 
When the nonfacing option is present, the part or chapter title will be placed on the following page.

----
[%nonfacing]
= Chapter Title

Chapter content
----
