== Continuous Integration with Github and Jenkins via webhooks


You can trigger a `Jenkins` build after each change in on your `GitHub` repository.

To enable this, navigate to the repository and click on menu:Settings[Integrations & services].
Click on `Add Service` and choose the `Jenkins (Github Plugin)` integration.

The Jenkins webhook url follows the pattern `<Jenkins url>/github-webhook`.

Now add the https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/GitHub+Plugin[Jenkins GitHub Plugin] to your Jenkins instance.
Make sure you have your Jenkins build correctly configured for the GitHub repository.
Navigate to the Configure page of your Jenkins build.
Under "Build Triggers" choose the option "Build when a change is pushed to GitHub".

After your next commit to the repository a new Jenkins build should start automatically.
