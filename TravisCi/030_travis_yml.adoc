== .travis.yml Configuration

Travis requires a _.travis.yml_ file to run.
As a minimum this file must specify the programming language to be used.
For Java, Travis supports Maven and Gradle as build system out of the box.

A minimal _.travis.yml_ file for a Maven or Gradle project looks like the following:


[source, yml]
----
language: java
----


_.travis.yml_ files can be valided here: http://lint.travis-ci.org/

Supported programming languages can be found here: https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/

A usual _.travis.yml_ file for a Java project, which uses Gradle could look like this:

[source, yml]
----
language: java
# use Java 8
jdk:
- oraclejdk8

# see https://blog.travis-ci.com/2014-12-17-faster-builds-with-container-based-infrastructure
sudo: false

# cache the build tool's caches
cache:
  directories:
  - $HOME/.m2
  - $HOME/.gradle
----


[NOTE]
====
When a Gradle wrapper is available Travis CI will build your project by using the `gradlew build` command.

Please ensure to upload all Gradle wrapper files, including the _gradle-wrapper.jar_ file, which might be filtered by the _.gitignore_ file.
