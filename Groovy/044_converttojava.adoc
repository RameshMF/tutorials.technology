[[converttogroovy]]
== Exercise: Convert a Java project to Groovy
[[converttogroovy_project]]
=== Create a Java project script

Use the Eclipse wizard to create a new _Java project_ called `com.vogella.groovy.fromjava` and create a package called `fromjava`.

[[converttogroovy_javabean]]
=== Create a Java class

Create a Java bean in this project called `Task` with two properties.

[source,java]
----
include::res/first/Task1.java[]
----

Use the code generation capacities of the Eclipse IDE to generate getter and setter, the constructor, the `toString` and `equals` and `hashcode` method.

[source,java]
----
include::res/first/Task.java[]
----

[[converttogroovy_main]]
=== Main method

Create a new class with a main method In this method construct at least one instance of `Task`.

[source,java]
----
include::res/first/MainTest.java[]
----

[[converttogroovy_convert]]
=== Convert to Groovy

Right-click on your project and select menu:Configure[Convert to Groovy Project]. 
This adds the Groovy libraries to the project classpath and adds the Groovy builder.

Right-click on your `Task` class and select menu:Convert[Convert file extension to Groovy].

[[converttogroovy_project_validate]]
=== Simplify the Task class

Simplify the `Task` class and ensure that the Java main program still can use it.

Congratulation! You converted your first object to Groovy and used it in an Java program.

[[converttogroovy_project_asttransformation]]
=== Replace the toString and equals/hashCode method

NOTE: This exercise is optional.

Use `@EqualsAndHashCode` and the `@ToString` to allow the Groovy compiler to create these methods during its compile phase.

These annotations triggers a so called AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) transformation during compilation. 
See <<asttransformations>> for more details.
