== GPath

GPath is a path expression language integrated into Groovy which allows parts of nested structured data to be identified.
In this sense, it has similar aims and scope as XPath does for XML.
The two main places where you use GPath expressions is when dealing with nested POJOs or when dealing with XML.

For example the `a.b.c` statement is equivalent to `a.getB().getC()`.

GPath navigation works also in complex structures like XML or JSON.
