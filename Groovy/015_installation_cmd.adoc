== Install Groovy for the command line

To be able to run Groovy code from the command line download the latest version from Groovy from the http://www.groovy-lang.org/download.html[Groovy download website].

Download at least the binary zip file and extract it to a directory on your hard disk.
Afterwards set the GROOVY_HOME environment variable and %GROOVY_HOME%/bin to your path.

If you are using MS Windows you can use the Windows installer.
This installer configured the environment variables automatically for you.
