== Exercise: Create and run a Groovy script with the Eclipse IDE

[[firstgroovyscript_target]]
=== Target of this exercise
In this exercise you learn how to create a Groovy script with the Eclipse IDE.

[[firstgroovyscript_project]]
=== Create a new Groovy script

Use the Eclipse wizard to create a new _Groovy class_ in your existing project.

Remove everything from it and replace it with the following code.

[source,text]
----
include::res/first/HelloWorld.groovy[]
----

[[firstgroovyscript_project_run]]
=== Run the Groovy class

Right-click your Groovy script, and select menu:Run As[Groovy Script] from the context menu.

[[firstgroovyscript_project_validate]]
=== Validate the Groovy script

The above menu entry triggers the execution of the script and prints output to _Console_ view of the Eclipse IDE.

Congratulation! You created and ran your first Groovy script.

[[firstgroovyscript_project_decompile]]
=== Decompile the Groovy class file

NOTE: This exercise is optional.

If you are familiar with a Java decompiler, like the JadClipse plug-in, decompile the class file generated from your Groovy source file and review it.

Ensure that it is an instance of `groovy.lang.Script`.
