[[groovyobjects]]
== Groovy classes, objects and methods

[[groovycode_class]]
=== A Groovy class and default access modifier

A Groovy class is defined with the `class` keyword, similar to Java.
All Groovy classes and methods are by default public.


The following is an example Groovy class called `Task.groovy`.

[[groovyobjects_fields]]
=== Groovy objects (Plain Old Groovy Objects) and fields

In Groovy all fields of a class have by default the `private` access modifier.
Groovy creates automatically getter and setter methods for the fields.
If you annotate the class or a property with the `@Bindable`annotation, Groovy also adds `PropertyChangeSupport` to the class or property.
Such a Groovy classes fits to the _Java beans_ specification.

Groovy objects are frequently referred to as _Plain Old Groovy Objects (POGO)_.

You can use the getter and setter directly or use the name of the field for access. Groovy also supports the array subscript acessor
(object[property]).
Groovy uses the getter or setter method, even if you directly use the name of the field.
If a field should not be changeable define it as `final`, in this case Groovy will not provide a setter.

[[groovyobjects_constructors]]
=== Constructors

Groovy provides _constructors with named parameters_ in which you can specify the element you would like to set during construction.
This constructor is also called _map based constructor_, as it uses the `property:value` map syntax.

If such a constructor is used, Groovy calls the default constructor and then calls the setter methods for the attributes.
This "constructor with named parameters" works also if you call a Java class from Groovy code as Groovy uses again the default constructor of the Java class and then the methods to set the properties.

The usage of the constructors with named parameters is demonstrated by the following example.

[[groovyobjects_equals]]
=== Equals, == and the method is()
 
One difference between Java and Groovy is that the == operator will check for equality and not for identity.
Java checks if both variables points to the same object while Groovy checks if both variables are equals.
To check for identify you can use in Groovy the is() method.

In Groovy null == null returns true.
If two references point to the same object it is also true.
If an object implements the `compareTo` method, Comparable this method is used, otherwise the `equals` method.

[[groovyobjects_parameter]]
=== Optional parameters in methods

Groovy allows to have optional parameter values.
Optional parameter values are indicated by =0.

[[groovyobjects_default_parameter]]
=== Default parameters in methods

In Groovy you assign default values to parameters in a method. 
If a default value for a parameter is defined, Groovy offers two method signatures: one with all parameters and one where the parameter with a default value is omitted.
If you use multiple parameters with default values then the right most parameter with a default value is first eliminated then the next, etc.
