== Dart

The Dart programming language is a pretty new language from Google.
It is widely used at Google and can be used for pretty much any kind of programming.
Be it mobile app development (using Flutter), web development (using Dart2JS) or run it on a server (using various libraries and frameworks), Dart should be able to handle everything.

But it should be noted that the language is not that old and only recently gained traction in the development community.

The object oriented language is very approachable for developers from various different languages as it's syntax is close to Java or C++.
