== Installation
It is strongly advised to install the latest version from the official website: https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html
The version in the system package manager is often outdated or is missing dependencies.
Download the package for your OS or distribution and use it to install Vagrant.

For this tutorial we will use VirtualBox as the provider.
On Ubuntu you can install it with the following command.

[source, terminal]
----
sudo apt install virtualbox
