== The Vagrantfile

=== Giving the VM a private IP

Add this to your configuration block to bind the guest VM to an IP that is only reachable by the host.

[source, ruby]
----
config.vm.network :private_network, ip: "192.168.192.200"
----


=== Giving the VM a public IP

Add this to your configuration block to give the VM a public IP.
Vagrant will ask you during VM startup to which network adapter the IP should be bound.

[source, ruby]
----
config.vm.network :public_network, ip: "192.168.192.200"
----

=== Changing the ssh port of the VM

If you change the ssh port of the guest machine, you have to let Vagrant know about the new port.
Otherwise `vagrant ssh` and other functionality won't work.

[source, ruby]
----
config.ssh.port=2222
----
