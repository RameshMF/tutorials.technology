== Exercise: Setting up a VM with Vagrant
In this exercise you will set up an Ubuntu VM using Vagrant.

You can find Vagrant boxes on the https://app.vagrantup.com/boxes/search[Vagrant Cloud].
For this exercise we'll use https://app.vagrantup.com/ubuntu/boxes/xenial64[ubuntu/xenial64].

Create a new directory that will contain your Vagrantfile.

[source, terminal]
----
mkdir ubuntu_xenial64_box
cd ubuntu_xenial64_box
----

Now create the Vagrantfile using the box and start the VM.

[source, terminal]
----
vagrant init ubuntu/xenial64
vagrant up
----

To validate that the box is actually running you can connect to it via ssh:

[source, terminal]
----
vagrant ssh
----
