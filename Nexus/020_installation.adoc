== Installation of Nexus

In order to install the open source version of Nexus you need to visit
https://www.sonatype.com/download-oss-sonatype[Nexus OSS]
and download the TGZ
version or the ZIP version. Currently the latest version is 3.13.0.

To start Nexus, after extracting, the
`nexus`
script must be
executed with a
`start`
parameter in the
`nexus`
folder:

`﻿﻿cd /NEXUS_FOLDER/nexus ./bin/nexus start`

And in case you want to stop Nexus you just have to write stop instead of start:

`﻿﻿cd /NEXUS_FOLDER/nexus ./bin/nexus stop`
