=== IDE support for Gradle
	
The Gradleware company is developing Eclipse Gradle tooling via the Eclipse Buildship project.
Other IDEs like IntelliJ and Android Studio already include also good Gradle support. 
See http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseGradle/article.html[Eclipse Gradle tutorial] for the usage of Gradle with Eclipse.
