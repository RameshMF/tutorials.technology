[[derby_modes]]
=== Server vs. embedded mode

Derby can be used in a _server mode_ and in a so-called _embedded mode_.
If Derby runs in the _server mode_ you start the Derby network server which will be responsible for handling the database requests. 
In _embedded mode_ Derby runs within the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) of the application. 
In this mode only the application can access the database, e.g. another user / application will not be able to access the database.
